# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Some important informetion about my site (Quiz-Class)

1. This site is very simple and easy to learn. On the otherhand it is very helpful to them who wants to participate a quiz test.

2. This site has some routes on navbar. If you click on it, the routes takes you to another page.

3. In topic page there are some cards. If you click on the card the quiz comes in another route.

4. After clicking quiz test button, a route takes you to the router. There are many quizes in the route.

5. Here I use toast to show correct and incorrect answer. It shows (correct answer)  ones that are correct and shows (incorrect answer) ones that are incorrect.

6. On the quiz part I use a Eyeicon. If you click this icon you get correct answer.

7. In statistic page there is a simple line chat. It helps to understand  about quiz quentity.
